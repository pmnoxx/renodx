# Display Commander - TODO and Issues

This folder contains documentation of known issues, TODOs, and technical debt for each source file in the Display Commander addon.

## Purpose

- **Track known issues** that need to be resolved
- **Document technical debt** and areas for improvement
- **Maintain a list of TODOs** for future development
- **Provide context** for developers working on the codebase

## File Structure

Each `.cpp` file has a corresponding `.md` file documenting:
- Known issues and bugs
- TODO items
- Technical debt
- Performance concerns
- Code quality issues

## How to Use

1. **When fixing an issue**: Update the corresponding .md file
2. **When adding new code**: Check relevant .md files for existing issues
3. **When planning work**: Review .md files to prioritize tasks
4. **When reviewing code**: Reference .md files for context

## File Naming Convention

- `filename.md` corresponds to `filename.cpp`
- Use clear, descriptive issue titles
- Include severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Add timestamps for when issues were identified
- Link to related issues or pull requests when applicable
