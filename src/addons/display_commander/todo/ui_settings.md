- [ ] Add setting change history
- [ ] Implement undo/redo for setting changes

## Technical Debt

### 1. Setting Organization
- **Issue**: Settings are not always logically grouped
- **Impact**: User confusion and maintenance overhead
- **Solution**: Reorganize settings into logical categories

### 2. Setting Validation
- **Issue**: Limited validation for setting values
- **Impact**: Potential invalid configurations
- **Solution**: Implement comprehensive setting validation

### 3. UI Mode Management
- **Issue**: UI modes could be better organized
- **Impact**: Code complexity and user experience
- **Solution**: Implement better mode organization and documentation

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Setting Updates
- **Issue**: Some settings may trigger expensive operations
- **Impact**: UI responsiveness during setting changes
- **Solution**: Implement async setting updates where appropriate

### 2. Window Information Display
- **Issue**: Window information may be expensive to gather
- **Impact**: UI performance during window info display
- **Solution**: Implement caching and lazy loading

### 3. UI Rendering
- **Issue**: Complex UI elements may impact rendering performance
- **Impact**: Reduced frame rates during UI interaction
- **Solution**: Optimize UI rendering and implement virtual scrolling

## Code Quality Issues

### 1. File Size
- **Issue**: File is quite large (1792 lines)
- **Impact**: Harder to maintain and understand
- **Solution**: Consider breaking into smaller, focused modules

### 2. Setting Definition
- **Issue**: Setting definitions are verbose and repetitive
- **Impact**: Maintenance overhead and potential inconsistencies
- **Solution**: Implement setting definition macros or templates

### 3. Error Handling
- **Issue**: Limited error handling for setting operations
- **Impact**: Difficult to debug issues
- **Solution**: Add comprehensive error handling and logging
