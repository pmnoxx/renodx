# audio_management.cpp - TODO and Issues

## Overview
This file handles audio management functionality including process-level audio muting, volume control, and background audio monitoring. It also handles background FPS limiting based on window focus state.

## Known Issues

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues
None currently identified.

### ðŸŸ  High Priority Issues

#### 1. Audio Session Management
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Description**: Audio session management uses complex COM interfaces that may fail in some scenarios
- **Impact**: Audio control may not work properly on some systems
- **Date Identified**: 2024-12-19

#### 2. Background FPS Limiting
- **Status**: TODO
- **Description**: Background FPS limiting is mixed with audio management functionality
- **Impact**: Code organization and maintainability
- **Date Identified**: 2024-12-19

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Issues

#### 1. COM Initialization
- **Status**: TODO
- **Description**: COM initialization may fail or conflict with other COM usage
- **Impact**: Audio functionality may not work
- **Date Identified**: 2024-12-19

#### 2. Process ID Matching
- **Status**: TODO
- **Description**: Process ID matching for audio sessions may not work in all scenarios
- **Impact**: Audio control may affect wrong processes
- **Date Identified**: 2024-12-19

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority Issues
None currently identified.

## TODO Items

### ðŸ”§ Immediate Tasks

#### 1. Separate FPS Limiting Logic
- [ ] Move background FPS limiting to a separate module
- [ ] Keep audio management focused on audio functionality
- [ ] Update includes and dependencies
- [ ] Test that functionality still works

#### 2. Improve Error Handling
- [ ] Add better error handling for COM failures
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms for audio control
- [x] Add logging for debugging audio issues
- [ ] Handle COM initialization conflicts

### ðŸ“‹ Future Improvements

#### 1. Audio Device Management
- [ ] Add support for multiple audio devices
- [ ] Implement audio device selection
- [ ] Add audio device information display
- [ ] Support for audio device hot-plugging

#### 2. Audio Session Control
- [ ] Improve process identification for audio sessions
- [ ] Add support for multiple audio sessions per process
- [ ] Implement audio session enumeration
- [ ] Add audio session information display

#### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize audio monitoring frequency
- [ ] Implement efficient audio state caching
- [ ] Add adaptive monitoring based on system load
- [ ] Consider async audio operations

## Technical Debt

### 1. Mixed Responsibilities
- **Issue**: File handles both audio management and FPS limiting
- **Impact**: Violates single responsibility principle
- **Solution**: Separate into focused modules

### 2. COM Complexity
- **Issue**: COM interface usage is complex and error-prone
- **Impact**: Potential failures and maintenance overhead
- **Solution**: Simplify and document COM usage

### 3. Error Recovery
- **Issue**: Limited error recovery for audio failures
- **Impact**: Reduced functionality when audio control fails
- **Solution**: Implement comprehensive error recovery

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Audio Monitoring Frequency
- **Issue**: Audio monitoring runs every 300ms
- **Impact**: Potential performance overhead
- **Solution**: Implement configurable monitoring frequency

### 2. COM Operations
- **Issue**: COM operations may be expensive
- **Impact**: Performance impact during audio control
- **Solution**: Optimize COM usage and implement caching

### 3. Process Enumeration
- **Issue**: Enumerating audio sessions may be expensive
- **Impact**: Performance impact during audio control
- **Solution**: Implement efficient session tracking and caching

## Code Quality Issues

### 1. Function Complexity
- **Issue**: Some functions are complex and handle multiple responsibilities
- **Impact**: Harder to maintain and debug
- **Solution**: Break down complex functions into smaller, focused functions

### 2. Error Logging
- **Issue**: Error logging could be more detailed and helpful
- **Impact**: Difficult to diagnose issues
- **Solution**: Improve error messages and add context information

### 3. Resource Management
- **Issue**: COM resource cleanup could be improved
- **Impact**: Potential resource leaks
- **Solution**: Implement RAII patterns for COM resources
