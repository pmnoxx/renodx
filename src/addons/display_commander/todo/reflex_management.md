# reflex_management.cpp - TODO and Issues

## Overview
This file contains NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency technology integration, including ETW marker management, sleep mode handling, and Reflex state management.

## Known Issues

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues
None currently identified.

### ðŸŸ  High Priority Issues

#### 1. Reflex Features Not Functional
- **Status**: Known Issue
- **Description**: Several Reflex features are marked as "(NOT FUNCTIONAL)" in the UI
- **Impact**: Users cannot use core Reflex functionality
- **Date Identified**: 2024-12-19
- **Related**: UI shows "(NOT FUNCTIONAL)" for `s_reflex_low_latency_mode`, `s_reflex_low_latency_boost`, `s_reflex_use_markers`

#### 2. ETW Marker Implementation
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Description**: ETW markers are being sent but may not be properly integrated with Reflex system
- **Impact**: Reflex latency measurements may be inaccurate
- **Date Identified**: 2024-12-19

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Issues

#### 1. Verbose Debug Output
- **Status**: Partially Resolved
- **Description**: Reflex debug messages can be very verbose and impact performance
- **Impact**: Log spam and potential performance impact
- **Date Identified**: 2024-12-19
- **Solution**: Added `s_reflex_debug_output` toggle to control debug output

#### 2. Sleep Mode Management
- **Status**: TODO
- **Description**: Sleep mode transitions may not be properly handled in all scenarios
- **Impact**: Potential system instability during sleep/wake cycles
- **Date Identified**: 2024-12-19

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority Issues
None currently identified.

## TODO Items

### ðŸ”§ Immediate Tasks

#### 1. Fix Non-Functional Reflex Features
- [ ] Investigate why `s_reflex_low_latency_mode` is not working
- [ ] Fix `s_reflex_low_latency_boost` functionality
- [ ] Implement proper `s_reflex_use_markers` behavior
- [ ] Test with actual Reflex-compatible games

#### 2. ETW Marker Integration
- [ ] Verify ETW markers are properly received by Reflex system
- [ ] Test marker timing accuracy
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for failed marker sends
- [ ] Add validation that markers are working

### ðŸ“‹ Future Improvements

#### 1. Reflex Feature Completeness
- [ ] Implement full Reflex Low Latency Mode support
- [ ] Add Reflex Low Latency Boost functionality
- [ ] Implement proper marker usage controls
- [ ] Add Reflex state validation and health checks

#### 2. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize ETW marker sending frequency
- [ ] Implement marker batching for better performance
- [ ] Add adaptive marker timing based on system load
- [ ] Consider async marker sending

#### 3. Error Handling and Recovery
- [ ] Add proper error handling for Reflex API failures
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms when Reflex is unavailable
- [ ] Add automatic recovery from Reflex errors
- [ ] Improve logging for debugging Reflex issues

## Technical Debt

### 1. Incomplete Reflex Implementation
- **Issue**: Many Reflex features are stubbed out or not fully implemented
- **Impact**: Reduced functionality, user confusion
- **Solution**: Complete the Reflex implementation or clearly document limitations

### 2. ETW Marker Complexity
- **Issue**: ETW marker system is complex and may have edge cases
- **Impact**: Potential bugs and maintenance overhead
- **Solution**: Simplify and document the marker system

### 3. Sleep Mode Handling
- **Issue**: Sleep mode transitions may not be properly handled
- **Impact**: System instability
- **Solution**: Implement proper sleep mode state management

## Performance Considerations

### 1. ETW Marker Frequency
- **Issue**: Markers are sent every frame, which may be excessive
- **Impact**: Performance overhead
- **Solution**: Implement configurable marker frequency

### 2. Debug Output
- **Issue**: Verbose debug output can impact performance
- **Impact**: Reduced frame rates during heavy logging
- **Solution**: Make debug output configurable and disable by default

### 3. Reflex State Checks
- **Issue**: Frequent Reflex state checks may impact performance
- **Impact**: Potential frame rate drops
- **Solution**: Implement efficient state caching and checking

## Code Quality Issues

### 1. Feature Completeness
- **Issue**: Many Reflex features are not fully implemented
- **Impact**: Code appears incomplete
- **Solution**: Either complete implementation or clearly mark as experimental

### 2. Error Handling
- **Issue**: Limited error handling for Reflex API calls
- **Impact**: Difficult to debug issues
- **Solution**: Add comprehensive error handling and logging

### 3. Configuration Management
- **Issue**: Reflex settings may not be properly validated
- **Impact**: Potential invalid configurations
- **Solution**: Add configuration validation and bounds checking
